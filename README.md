tinkering with teh raspberry pi


quick notes for auto phone home on a Pi

install raspian (but any other OS should work) 
enable sshd 
enable rc-local.service

created a passwordless ssh key 
creatte a user account dedicated to this host on the remote box 
add that ssh public key to the user on the remote host 

test that passwordless ssh works
debug if needed
